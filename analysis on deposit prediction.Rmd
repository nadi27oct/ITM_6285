Below UCI dataset is a "Bank Marketing" campaign that contains records of calls made by a Portugese bank to its clients, including client and campaign attributes. Analysis is based on classfication methods to understand if a customer is going to open a deposit account or not.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
Load all relevant libraries.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(mlbench)
library(foreign)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(scales)
library(e1071)
library(MASS)
library(klaR)
library(C50)
library(kernlab)
```


Read the data set on bank clients. Here, analysis is based on the smaller dataset that represents randomly selected 10% of the entire dataset, so that computationally demanding algorithms (eg: SVM) can be performed faster.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bank <- read_delim("~/Documents/homework/ITM_6285/bank-additional.csv",";",escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
bank <- subset(bank, select = -c(duration))
```
There are 20 attributes in the dataset. Since duration has a high correlation with the target variable, variable named 'duration' is removed from the dataset. 
Here is a breakdown of all 20 variables in the dataset along with variable data type.
The target variable is y which has two values: 'yes' (customer opens a bank account) and 'no' (customer does not open an account).
```{r}
sapply(bank,class)
```

To get an understanding of the data, lets visualize a few variables.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
table(bank$y)
```
The dataset contains 3668 'no' responses and 451 'yes' responses.
Below is the distribution by occupation and age.
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
barplot(table(bank$job),col="red",ylab="No. of Clients",las=2,main="Job",cex.names = 0.8,cex.axis = 0.8)
```
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
boxplot(bank$age~bank$y, main=" Age",ylab="Age of Clients",xlab="Deposit A/C Open or Not")
```

### Splitting Data for Testing and Training

Now the dataset of 4119 observations are splitted into training and test data. 
We use stratified sampling to split the data, so that distribution of the outcome within traning and testing datasets is preserved. We split the data with 75% (or 3090) of observations is used for training the model and 25% (or 1029) of observations is used to test the prediction outcome from the classifier model.
```{r}
set.seed(123456)
TrainingDataIndex <- createDataPartition(bank$y, p=0.75, list = FALSE)
train <- bank[TrainingDataIndex,]
test <-bank[-TrainingDataIndex,]
prop.table(table(train$y))
nrow(train)
prop.table(table(test$y))
nrow(test)
```

Thus, stratified sampling has enabled to maintain the distribution with about 89% of clients have responded 'no' to opening a deposit in both testing and training data set.

### 1. Decision Tree
#### Training the Model
After partitioning the data to train and test, use a 10 fold cross validation repeated 5 times to evaluate the model.

```{r}
TrainingParameters <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, repeats = 5)
```
Then create the decision tree using the C5.0 algorithm.

```{r}
DecTreeModel <- train(y ~ ., data = train, 
                      method = "C5.0",
                      trControl= TrainingParameters,
                      na.action = na.omit)
```

Lets take a look.
```{r}
DecTreeModel
```

```{r}
summary(DecTreeModel)
```
For instance, Rule 1 shows that when the number of employees in a quarter is greater than 5023, it was assigned the class 'no' (client does not want to open a bank account) 2816 times and out of 2816 times, the model incorrectly assigned 'no' 207 times.

Based on the training data confusion matrix, 9.5% of observations were assigned an incorrect class variable.

#### Testing the Model

```{r}
DTPredictions <-predict(DecTreeModel, test, na.action = na.pass)
confusionMatrix(DTPredictions, test$y)
```
Based on confusion matrix for test data, using the decision tree model we have correctly classified 911 + 15 = 926 observations and misclassified 6 + 97 = 103 representing a 90% accuracy.

### 2. Naive Bayes
#### Training the Model

The next machine learning method used to predict if a customer opens a bank account is Naive Bayes method.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
TrainingDataIndex <- createDataPartition(bank$y, p=0.75, list = FALSE)
train <- bank[TrainingDataIndex,]
test <-bank[-TrainingDataIndex,]
NBModel <- train(train[,-20], train$y, method = "nb",trControl= trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, repeats = 5))
NBModel
```

#### Testing the model

Below confusion matrix by class y shows that there is 89% accuracy in classification per Naive Bayes method.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
NBPredictions <-predict(NBModel, test)
confusionMatrix(NBPredictions, test$y)
```

### 3. Suppor Vector Machines
SVM is another classification method that can be used to predict if a client falls into either 'yes' or 'no' class.

#### Training the model
As before, create a prediction model using svmPoly method.
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
TrainingDataIndex <- createDataPartition(bank$y, p=0.75, list = FALSE)
train <- bank[TrainingDataIndex,]
test <-bank[-TrainingDataIndex,]
svm_model <- train(y~., data = train,
                   method = "svmPoly",
                   trControl= trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, repeats = 5),
                   tuneGrid = data.frame(degree = 1,scale = 1,C = 1))
svm_model
```

#### Testing the model
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#SVMPredictions <-predict(svm_model, test, na.action = na.pass)
#cmSVM <-confusionMatrix(SVMPredictions, test)
```
